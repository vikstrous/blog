### Introduction

Let's talk about global state in programming. We've all made excuses for using it, but there are better ways. Here, we'll address some common excuses and show why avoiding global state is a game-changer.

### Common Excuses for Using Global State

* **"I'll use this code only in this specific way."**
   Code often outgrows its initial purpose, leading to unexpected issues.

* **"It's just the logger, though!"**
   Even a logger can introduce hidden dependencies and headaches.

* **"I don't have time to structure this correctly!"**
   Shortcuts now can mean big problems later.

* **"We can still unit test this by modifying the global state."**
   This leads to fragile, hard-to-maintain tests.

* **"This one dependency I'm using requires it."**
   Dependencies can often be replaced or wrapped.

* **"It's just a CLI. There's only ever one instance of it, so who cares!"**
   Single-instance applications can still suffer from unpredictable behavior.

### Benefits of Avoiding Global State

So, what happens when you manage your state explicitly and pass it clearly between parts of your program? Let's dive in.

#### Composability

Functions that modify their inputs or produce new outputs can be composed with other functions, allowing for flexible data processing. Functions that rely on global state lack this composability, limiting their flexibility.

#### Clarity and Predictability

Functions that rely only on their inputs are easier to understand. If a struct doesn't have a random number generator, it's deterministic. No logger? No logging surprises.

#### Easier Testing

Without global state, tests are simpler and more reliable. You can run tests concurrently and use mock objects easily. Tests can be sped up by just adding more hardware.

#### Better Resource Management

Avoiding global state means managing resources better. An HTTP client created in a test will be properly shut down, preventing leaks and leftover processes.

#### Clean Process Termination

Centralizing environment variables and config files ensures clean exits. Metrics, traces, and logs are all handled before shutdown.

#### Simplified Debugging

Debugging is easier without global state. Issues are more predictable, and resource leaks are easier to find and fix.

### Conclusion

Avoiding global state brings clarity, better testing, resource management, and simpler debugging. The short-term convenience isn't worth the long-term trouble.
