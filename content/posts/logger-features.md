Go 1.21 will be released with many improvements that I appreciate, but the one that stands out to me the most is the addition of the log/slog package. It serves as a great foundation for a logging system, but there's a lot more to logging than what it offers out of the box. I published [a blog post](https://medium.com/anchorage/three-logging-features-to-improve-your-slog-f72300a7fb66) on the Anchorage Digital Blog that points out some logging features that can and should be added around this package. I hope others find this useful! Reach out on Twitter if you want tips on implementing any of what I wrote about.
